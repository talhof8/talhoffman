My name is Tal. I'm a highly experienced R&D Engineer with expertise and fluency in Go, Python and Linux programming in the cyber security field.  

I've been programming since the age of 12, starting my way as a Web Developer, working in the industry from the age of 13. I currently work at a small startup and looking to start my own gig someday :)  

I learn by writing.
 

**Some of my projects:**

* [Kashmir](https://github.com/talhof8/kashmir) - STM library for Go, inspired by Transactional Locking II
* [Gasper](https://github.com/talhof8/gasper) - a CLI for safe, privacy-aware file storage based on Shamir's Secret Sharing
