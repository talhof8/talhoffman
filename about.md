<p>Hi,</p>

<p>My name is Tal. I'm a highly experienced R&D Engineer with expertise and fluency in Go, Python and Linux programming in the cyber security field. I've been programming since the age of 12, starting my way as a Web Developer, working in the industry from the age of 13. I currently work at a small startup and looking to start my own gig someday :)

I learn by writing.</p>
